NiQuery
=======
NiQuery is (currently) and experimental project for accessing, querying, and computing with [NIDM](http://nidm.nidash.org) 
documents that provide provenance information about brain imaging datasets. Currently it is working towards demonstrating:

- a repository of SPARQL queries for NIDM described using turtle rdf
- a python library to ease the use of NIDM SPARQL queries
- an restful web api to execute queries
- queue management for executing nipype workflows
